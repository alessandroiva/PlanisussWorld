The project consists in the design and implementation of a simulation of a ficti- tious world called “Planisuss”, freely inspired by Wa-Tor and Conway’s Game of Life.
The Planisuss world is constituted of a single continent which is populated by three species: Veg- etob, Erbast, and Carviz. In the simulation, several individuals of the species interact evolving their population under the rules.
