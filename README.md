# PlanisussWorld

PlanisussWorld is a project that focuses on the design and implementation of a simulation of a fictitious world called "Planisuss," freely inspired by Wa-Tor and Conway's Game of Life. The Planisuss world is made up of a single continent populated by three species: Veg-etob, Erbast, and Carviz. In the simulation, several individuals of these species interact, evolving their population under the rules.

## Features

- Simulation of three species: Vegetob, Erbast, and Carviz.
- Interaction and evolution of species based on predefined rules.
- Visualization of the simulation progress.
